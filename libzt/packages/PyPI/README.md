 - `pip3 install dist/<package_name>.whl`

*Note: As there appears to be no way to differentiate C and C++ code (and thus pass correct build args to each type) in a setuptools script we must separately build the `lwip` and `http_parser` libraries, copy them here, and then build the binary. See the top-level [README.md](../../README.md) for instructions on how to do that*
